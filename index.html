      <p>My name is <strong>Allan Ndamukunda Hirwa</strong>, and my journey began as a young child fascinated by electronics. I would often dismantle household gadgets to understand how they worked, piecing them back together with newfound knowledge.

      <p>Today, I am a passionate web developer and cybersecurity enthusiast, specializing in creating responsive websites and securing digital environments. I strive to combine my technical skills with creativity to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.</p>
